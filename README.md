## CT417: Software Engineering III
* Name: _Fill up your name here_
* Student Id: _Fill you your Student-Id_
* Code coverage percentage: _Enter value here_

This is a repository for CT417 assignment. You will find a simple TimeTableApp for you to use in your CI/CD pipeline. Like all great trilogy (Star Wars I – VI :+1:, yes I – III are counted as canon, but never VII – IX :-1:), this assignment will be performed in various sub-parts. 

* ~~Version Control - Setup your project with Git / GitHub~~ 
* ~~Build Tools - Develop using Maven (Eclipse IDE)~~
* __Integrate - JUnit and GitHub Action CI/CD__

(Each 10 marks)

### TimeTableApp
This is a basic Java application to manage and display student, lecturer, and module information. It can assist in organizing and presenting course-related details. The application will be able to perform scheduling (semi-automatic) -- helping the university to create and manage class schedules, allocate lecturers to modules, and assign students to specific classes. You have the `Student`, `Lecturer`, `Module`, and `Schedular` classes pre-built in the source.

#### AS03: What you need to do?  
It’s time for part III, the final episode of our trilogy. It's time to wrap (speed?) things up by implementing some unit tests as a demonstration of how the TimeTable app can implement Test-Driven-Development (TDD) practices.  You will make use of your knowledge of security testing as discussed in class. Since security testing should be integrated anywhere in your CI/CD pipeline, we use GitHub Action to allow autonomous build and test pipeline. You need to set this up in your repository as the final deliverable for this assignment.

❗Do remember that the deadline for this task will be on the 12th of November 2023 (00:00)
